# Real-time-sign-language-detection
This project presents a real-time sign language detection system using deep learning techniques such as CNN and LSTM. It captures live video through a webcam, processes hand gestures, and translates them into text for easier communication. The system aims to bridge the gap between hearing-impaired individuals and the wider community.
